# Todo List Application
#### This is a simple Todo List application written in JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, while also providing functionality to sort tasks based on their creation time. The application utilizes localStorage to persist user data, ensuring that tasks are saved even after the browser is closed.
